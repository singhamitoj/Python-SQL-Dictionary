# Python-SQL-Dictionary
This is a simple dictionary app that I created in Python using SQL. 

# How does it work?
You can enter a word. Make sure the first letter is capitalized. Click the button (Don't press Enter) and the definition will pop up.

# What doesn't work?
- You can't press the enter key to complete the search. It makes a new line.
- Some definitions are not fully visible as they extend past the length of the window itself.
- Words with multiple definitions will not show all definitions.
