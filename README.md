# Python-SQL-Dictionary
This is a simple dictionary app that I created in Python using SQL. 

# How does it work?
You can enter a word. Click the button (Or press Enter) and the definition will pop up.

# What doesn't work?
- Words with multiple definitions will not show all definitions.
- The deb package doesn't install the following dependencies: tkinter (python3-tk), pkg_resources. Most systems should include them but barebones OSes may not.

# Fixed Bugs/New Features:
- Pressing the Enter key will bring up the definition.
- The definitions are now contained in a text box so that all of the text is visible.
- The input is no longer case-sensitive.
- New font for aesthetics.
- A deb package is available. Install it and run the command "sql-dictionary."
